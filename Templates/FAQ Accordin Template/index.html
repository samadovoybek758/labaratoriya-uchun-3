            Microsoft 365 is a subscription that includes the most collaborative, 
            up-to-date features in one seamless, integrated experience. Microsoft 365 
            includes the robust Office desktop apps that you're familiar with, like Word, 
            PowerPoint, and Excel. You also get extra online storage and cloud-connected features that let you 
            collaborate on files in real time. With a subscription.

                No. Apps are tailored to work best on each operating system. The apps available for Mac 
                users and the specific features included may be different from those available for PC users. 
                With Microsoft 365, you can be flexible. With your account, you are not limited to exclusively Mac or exclusively PC, so you can transition across devices.
